Risk-based testing is a software testing method that prioritizes testing efforts based on the potential risk ofa feature's failure. Instead of treating all tests equally
it focuses limited time and resources on the areasthat are most likely to have defects or where failure would have a significant impact on users or thebusiness.
This approach is especially beneficial for complex projects, tight timelines, or when dealing withhigh-risk systems.
Key principles:
1.Risk assessment: The process starts with identifying and assessing risks, such as the likelihood and impactof defects.
Risks can be based on factors like the criticality of the business function, frequency of use, or ahistory of defects.
2.Prioritization: Based on the risk assessment, test cases are prioritized. High-risk areas receive morethorough testing, while lower-risk areas may receive less testing.
3.Resource allocation: Testing resources are strategically allocated to ensure the most critical functions are tested first.
4.Continuous process: Risk-based testing is not a one-time activity; the test plan and strategy should berevisited and adjusted as the project progresses and new risks emerge.
Benefits:
1.Optimizes resources: It ensures that the most critical functionalities are tested thoroughly, especially whentime and budget are limited.
2.Improves quality: By focusing on critical areas, it helps improve the overall reliability and quality of thesoftware, leading to higher user satisfaction.
3.Reduces risk of failure: It proactively mitigates risks by focusing on high-impact areas, reducing the chancesof significant financial or data loss due to bugs.
4.Increases efficiency: It streamlines the testing process by reducing redundant tests and focusing effort .

When To use it:
1.There is time/resource or budget constraints.  
2.When a proof of concept is being implemented.
3.When the team is new to the technology platform or to the application under testing.
